Our variant, Connect 383, will have three main differences from the basic game. First, we will not be limited to 6x7 boards. Secondly, games may start 
with one or more "obstacle" pieces already on the board which do not belong to either player. Lastly, play will always continue until the board is 
completely full (even after a player has achieved 4-in-a-row), at which point scores for each player will be calculated.

Points are awarded as follows: for each run of length three or greater, the player will receive points equal to the square of the length of that run. 
For example, 3-in-a-row is worth 9 points, 4-in-a-row 16, 5-in-a-row 25, etc. 

To play a game, you run connect383.py from a command line (or within an IDE) and supply it with arguments that determine the parameters of the game and
which type of agents are playing. The required arguments are, in order: play1, play2, and brd.

The first two arguments specify the agent type for Player 1 and Player 2, respectively. Their value should be one of { random, human, mini, prune, lookN,
or altN }, where N is an integer specifying the depth limit for lookahead agents.

The third argument specifies the board type to play on. Its value can be a tag associated with a a predefined board in boards.py, or can take the form 
RxC where R and C are integers defining the number of rows and columns, respectively.
