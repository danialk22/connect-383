This is a variation of the classic game Connect 4 that utilizes advanced AI techniques to make the gameplay more challenging and engaging. The game employs a Minimax algorithm, which allows the computer to analyze all possible moves and choose the best one. The algorithm also uses Alpha-beta pruning, which reduces the number of branches the algorithm needs to check by discarding branches that are unlikely to produce the best result. Additionally, the game has an evaluation function that assigns a numerical value to each possible board state, allowing the computer to assign a score to each move and choose the one that is most likely to lead to a win. Overall, this variation of Connect 4 offers a more sophisticated and challenging gameplay experience for players who are looking for a deeper and more engaging game.
